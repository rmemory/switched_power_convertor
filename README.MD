A switched and linear regulated, are both common DC power supplies, which convert AC to DC. Switched supplies have the advantage of being much more efficient (80% vs 40%). The disadvantage of Switched supplies is they typically also produce residual ac noise and electromagnetic interference due to conversion of the incoming AC voltage to a higher frequency which allows using a smaller, more efficient transformer. On the other hand, linear regulated are larger, and disappate more heat. 

This circuit will use a switched power convertor, to allow switching from one DC voltage to another.
